# This will be the scoring system for each company
# Scoring will be based off of 2 factors:
# 1. Number of transactions where an item was returned (Debits to Customer)
# 2. Magnitude of the transactions

# Accepting a database (file type?) which will contain every single
# transaction made by every single customer (Jayson)

# Need to parse these transactions for company names that we are targeting
# These company names will need to be previously established (Paarth)
